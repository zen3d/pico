# pico
The pico teaching language created at Vrije Unversiteit Brussel (VUB) by Theo D'Hondt and Wolfgang De Meuter.

The primary web site for pico is:
  pico.vub.ac.be

While this web site offers downloads of version version (Mac, Win, Linux, and src), it appears that bit rot has set in and those downloads no longer appear to be available. This repo fills that gap (at least for a Linux text variant of pico).
