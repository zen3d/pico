WxPico is an unfinished and unmaintained project, mostly because nobody
is interested in actually using it.  Some extra bugs have popped up
in the OS X version with the newer 2.6 version of wxMac.  It still works
well enough in Linux.  I have not tried it in MS Windows recently.

MS Windows:
- closing Editors by clicking the [X] box fails; reason unknown
    tried lots of dirty hacks, none worked
- in Windows you must conclude input text for accept() with ctrl-enter

OS X:
- closing Editors by using the menu item Close leaves a zombie window
- get rid of the useless empty window

OpenBSD:
- investigate the error message about free() when closing

General bug:
- it may happen that the pico engine is still writing to a GUI window
    when it has been closed

Further development:
- support Undo better and maybe also Redo
    (not provided by wxGTK in wxTextCtrl at least up to 2.5.1)
- put FIND and BALANCE provided in PicoShell to good use
