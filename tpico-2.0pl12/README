In tpico, the arrow keys will access a command line history of
up to 500 lines, which are also saved to ~/.tpico_history.
Ctrl-C will either end a running computation, or kill the
interpreter, when there is no running computation.

There is a man page with further information on tpico.

This package includes what was once called a work-in-progress
version of wxPico, a GUI version based on wxWidgets, and
what is now simply called unmaintained, unused code.

The current interpreter cannot be run reliably on processors
that align data on 8-byte boundaries.  (Think Sun SPARC.)
